# RaycasterDemo
Wonky version of a raycaster using basic math and Java Swing from scratch

Things that need to be fixed:
1. Fisheye distortion effect, caused by equally long distance rays casted by the player
2. Wall collision detection
3. Controls to change FOV, sensitivity and player movement speed
4. Variations of walls
